# Statistical Analysis techniques

You can find the data here! : [Data](#data)

We are gonna use some analysis techniques to figure out if our subset of data can give us some insights to the bigger picture. And if we find a relation is it really a relation or just due to chance.

## Data:

This is a very specific dataset for the !Kung San people, but it has height, weight, sex, and age fields. Found from this stack exchange question : [Question on Stack Exchange](https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/7793/age-weight-and-height-dataset)

- [Howell 1](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/blob/master/data/Howell1.csv)
- [Howell 2](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/blob/master/data/Howell2.csv)

```

Fields of the data Howell 2:
