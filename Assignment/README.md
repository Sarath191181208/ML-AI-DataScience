#### [Question2](./ASSI_1/Question2.ipynb)

A multinational bank is concerned about the waiting time of its customers for using their ATMs. A study of a random sample of 500 customers reveals the following probability distribution:

| <center>x</center>( waiting time of <br> customer in min) | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| p(x):                                                     | 0.20 | 0.18 | 0.16 | 0.12 | 0.10 | 0.09 | 0.08 | 0.04 | 0.03 |

a) Probability that a customer wil have to wait for more than 5 minutes ? <br>
b) Probability that a customer need not wait ? <br>
c) Probability that a customer wil have to wait for less than 4 minutes ?
