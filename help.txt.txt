cost function -> ex: mean squared error
gradient descent -> helps to find best fit line 

# Saving the sklearn model 
1)
	with open('model','wb') as f: #here wb -> write binary
		pickle.dump(model,f)

........using the model
	with open('model','rb') as f: # here rb -> read binary
		model = pickle.load('model')
2)

from sklearn.externals import joblib # useful for large datasets
	
	joblib.dump(model,'model')

........using the model
	model = joblib.load('model')

........ importing random forest 

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifer

........ importing svm
from sklearn.svm import SVR

3)

Null hypothesis - No statistical relation ship.
Alternate hypothesis - There is a statistical relationship.
