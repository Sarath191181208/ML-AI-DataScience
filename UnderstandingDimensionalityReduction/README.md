### Principal Component Analysis
- A dimensional reduction technique
- Steps:
  1. Standardize the data 
  2. Take mean and center it around origin
  3. Find the best fit line (eigenvector) that explains the most variance
  4. Analyze the variance explained by each eigenvector (scree plot)
  5. Choose the number of eigenvectors to keep 
  6. Project the data onto the new subspace
